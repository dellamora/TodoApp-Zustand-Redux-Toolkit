## Using the Todo Apps

Both Todo Apps offer the same functionality: creating tasks, marking them as complete, and deleting them. However, they use different state management libraries.


## Redux Toolkit Todo App

The Redux Toolkit Todo App uses the Redux library for state management. To add a new task, simply type in the task name and press "Enter". To mark a task as complete, click on the checkbox next to the task name. To delete a task, click on the "trash" button next to the task name.

## Zustand Todo App

The Zustand Todo App uses the Zustand library for state management. To add a new task, simply type in the task name and press "Enter". To mark a task as complete, click on the checkbox next to the task name. To delete a task, click on the "trash" button next to the task name.


## Conclusion

Use Zustand
